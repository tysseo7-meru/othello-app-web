# Othello — CPU Web App (Project No.4, Phase 1)

A complete, playable Othello (Reversi) game against a CPU opponent, built as a
plain static web app: **vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, no frameworks.**
`index.html` sits at the project root so it can be served from a domain root.

> **Hosting plan (Akira's decision, 2026-11-03):** spec item 18 (source must
> stay private) was **withdrawn** — the GitHub repo for this app will be
> **public**, under `tysseo7-meru`, and the app will be hosted on **GitHub
> Pages** from that public repo. (Repo creation/publishing is a separate step;
> this directory is the deployable content as-is.)

> **Phase 2 (later):** conversion for the Pi testnet / Pi Browser (Pi SDK
> integration, Pi username) is intentionally NOT included in phase 1.

## Features

- Standard Othello rules, 8×8. You are **Black** and move first. A player with
  no legal move passes; the game ends when both sides pass or the board is
  full; more discs wins; draws are possible.
- CPU difficulty (chosen on the top screen):
  - **Low** — noisy 1-ply greedy (random blunders).
  - **Mid** — positional greedy: corners first, avoids corner-adjacent squares
    while the corner is empty, flip count as tiebreak.
  - **High** — alpha-beta minimax, depth 6, positional + mobility evaluation;
    exact endgame search when ≤ 12 squares remain.
  - CPU "thinks" for ~600 ms so play feels natural.
- Legal-move hint markers, disc flip animations, and a wooden **"コト" click**
  (WebAudio-synthesized) on every placement and flip.
- Every button press plays a short **"ポチ" pop** (WebAudio-synthesized),
  wired by event delegation so all buttons — present and future — get it.
- Countdown: big graphical 3-2-1 plus a childlike synthesized voice —
  "3、2、1、ゲームスタート" (Japanese UI) or "3, 2, 1, Game start!" (English UI).
- BGM: Pachelbel's **Canon in D major** — our own rendition
  **synthesized at runtime with WebAudio**. The composition is public
  domain; no recording is used, so no performer's rights are involved.
  The arrangement loops 8 passes of the famous 8-chord ground
  (D–A–Bm–F♯m–G–D–G–A) with the 2-bar bass ostinato, flowing eighth-note
  arpeggios, and the first violin's melody (the F♯–E–D–B entry and the
  F♯–E–D–C♯–B–A–B–C♯ scale phrase) at quarter ≈ 66 — about 58 s per loop.
  Toggle on/off any time (top screen and in-game); the preference persists.
  Starts only after the first user gesture (autoplay policy).
- UI language: **English (default) / Japanese**, switchable on the top screen;
  every UI string goes through the EN/JA table in `js/i18n.js`. Persists.
- Username is required before a game; it persists in the browser.

## Ranking (wins only)

A win (and only a win) is recorded in the ranking database:

- Each browser keeps a persistent random **playerId** (UUID, localStorage).
- Record: `{ playerId, displayName, total, low, mid, high, updatedAt }`,
  where `updatedAt` is the time of the win that produced the current totals.
- **Display name rule:** at a player's first recorded win, their display name
  is their chosen username — unless a *different* playerId already holds that
  name, in which case they get `name(n)` with the smallest free natural
  number `n ≥ 2`. A player always merges into their own record and keeps the
  name they were first assigned.
- Ranking screen: sorted by total wins (desc), ties broken by `updatedAt`
  (earlier achiever first); **competition ranking** (1, 2, 2, 4). Every row
  with rank ≤ 30 is shown, so with ties the list can exceed 30 rows. Columns:
  rank, username, total wins, wins per level. Reachable after a game and from
  the top screen.

### Data backends (`js/db.js`)

One interface, two backends, selected by `js/config.js`:

| Mode | When | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| **local** (default) | `firebase: null` in config | browser `localStorage` (`othello.rankings.v1`) |
| **cloud** | `firebase: {...}` filled in | Cloud Firestore, collection `rankings`, doc id = playerId, via the official Firebase compat SDK from CDN |

> GitHub Pages is static hosting, so in cloud mode the browser talks to
> Firestore directly; the Firestore security rules are what protect the data.

### Reset

Open the app with **`?adm=reset&key=<RESET_KEY>`** to wipe all ranking records
(a confirmation banner is shown). The key lives in `js/config.js`
(`RESET_KEY`). **Because the repo is public, the key is visible in the
source** — it prevents only accidental/casual resets, it is not access
control.

## Configuration (`js/config.js`)

```js
window.APP_CONFIG = {
  RESET_KEY: "…",   // see above
  firebase: null    // fill with your Firebase web config to enable cloud mode:
                    // { apiKey, authDomain, projectId, appId }
};
```

## Assets & provenance

- `assets/countdown_ja.mp3`, `assets/countdown_en.mp3` — generated with a
  text-to-speech voice ("Giddy Confetti", bright/high female), then
  pitch-shifted ×1.32 with ffmpeg (tempo restored) to sound childlike.
  If a clip ever fails to load/play, the app falls back to the browser's
  `speechSynthesis` with pitch 1.6.
- BGM (a WebAudio-synthesized rendition of Pachelbel's Canon in D major;
  public-domain composition, own rendition) and the click/pop
  sounds: synthesized with WebAudio at runtime — no files, no third-party
  licenses involved.
- The favicon is an inline SVG data URI in `index.html`.

## Run locally

```sh
cd othello-app
python3 -m http.server 8901
# open http://localhost:8901/
```

(Any static server works. Opening `index.html` via `file://` mostly works too,
but `localStorage`/audio behave best over http.)

## Tests

```sh
node tests/engine_test.js        # rules engine + CPU legality + ranking helpers (15 tests)
node tests/audio_test.js         # Canon arrangement data validation + no-AudioContext safety
# DOM end-to-end (needs the local server above and jsdom: npm install jsdom)
NODE_PATH=<path-to-jsdom>/node_modules node tests/dom_test.js       # 18 checks incl. a full game
NODE_PATH=<path-to-jsdom>/node_modules node tests/dom_win_test.js   # win path: win -> saved -> ranking record
node tests/e2e_cdp.js            # optional: real-Chromium CDP test where a standalone
                                 # headless Chromium is available (CHROME_BIN)
```
